Generates terse, conventional-format commit messages. Why over what.

## Rules

**Subject line:**
- `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>` — `<scope>` optional
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `style`, `revert`
- Imperative mood: "add", "fix", "remove" — not "added", "adds", "adding"
- ≤50 chars when possible, hard cap 72
- No trailing period

**Body (only if needed):**
- Skip entirely when subject is self-explanatory
- Add body only for: non-obvious *why*, breaking changes, migration notes, linked issues
- Wrap at 72 chars
- Bullets `-` not `*`
- Reference issues/PRs at end: `Closes #42`, `Refs #17`

**Never include:**
- "This commit does X", "I", "we", "now", "currently" — the diff says what
- "As requested by..." — use Co-authored-by trailer
- AI attribution in the message body
- Emoji (unless project convention requires)
- Restating the file name when scope already says it

## Examples

Diff: new endpoint for user profile
```
feat(api): add GET /users/:id/profile

Mobile client needs profile data without the full user payload
to reduce LTE bandwidth on cold-launch screens.

Closes #128
```

Diff: breaking API change
```
feat(api)!: rename /v1/orders to /v1/checkout

BREAKING CHANGE: clients on /v1/orders must migrate to /v1/checkout
before 2026-06-01. Old route returns 410 after that date.
```

## Auto-Clarity

Always include body for: breaking changes, security fixes, data migrations,
anything reverting a prior commit. Never compress these into subject-only.
